Bond lengths were found to deviate normally from the standard bond
lengths (values for Protein residues were taken from Engh and Huber
[REF]).
 
 Z-score for bond lengths: 0.669
 RMS-deviation in bond distances: 0.015
 
19. Warning: Directionality in bond lengths Warning

Comparison of bond distances with Engh and Huber [REF] standard
values shows a significant systematic deviation. The bonds in one
direction are systematically longer than in other directions.

If this is not an XRAY structure this effect is hard to explain.
Otherwise you will have seen symmetry problems earlier. Please
correct these and rerun this check to see the implications on the
cell axes.

The bond angles listed in the table below were found to deviate
more than 4 sigma from standard bond angles (both standard values
and sigma have been taken from Engh and Huber [REF]).  In the table
below for each strange angle the bond angle and the number of
standard deviations it differs from the Engh and Huber values is
given. Please note that only bond angles within protein residues
are taken into account: disulphide bridges and peptide bonds are
neglected.

Bond angles were found to deviate normally from the mean Engh and
Huber [REF] standard bond angles. The RMS Z-score given below is
expected to be around 1.0 for a normally restrained data set, and
this is indeed observed for very high resolution X-ray structures.

22. Error: Side chain planarity problems Error

The side chains of the residues listed in the table below contain a
planar group that was found to deviate from planarity by more than
4.0 times the expected value.  For an amino acid residue that has a
side chain with a planar group, the RMS deviation of the atoms to a
least squares plane was determined. The number in the table is the
number of standard deviations this RMS value deviates from the
expected value (0.0).

26. Warning: Torsion angle evaluation shows unusual residues Warning

The residues listed in the table below contain bad or abnormal
torsion angles.

These scores give an impression of how ``normal'' the torsion
angles in protein residues are. All torsion angles except omega are
used for calculating a `normality' score. Average values and
standard deviations were obtained from the residues in the WHAT IF
database. These are used to calculate Z-scores.  A residue with a
Z-score of below -2.0 is poor, and a score of less than -3.0 is
worrying.  For such residues more than one torsion angle is in a
highly unlikely position.

27. Warning: Backbone torsion angle evaluation shows unusual conformations Warning

The residues listed in the table below have abnormal backbone torsion
angles.

Residues with ``forbidden'' phi-psi combinations are listed, as
well as residues with unusual omega angles (deviating by more than
3 sigma from the normal value). Please note that it is normal if
about 5 percent of the residues is listed here as having unusual
phi-psi combinations.

28. Note: Ramachandran Z-score OK Pass

The score expressing how well the backbone conformations of all residues
are corresponding to the known allowed areas in the Ramachandran plot is
within expected ranges for well-refined structures.
 
 Ramachandran Z-score : -0.782
 
29. Warning: Omega angle restraints not strong enough Warning

The omega angles for trans-peptide bonds in a structure is
expected to give a gaussian distribution with the average around
+178 degrees, and a standard deviation around 5.5. In the current
structure the standard deviation of this distribution is above 7.0,
which indicates that the omega values have been under-constrained.
 
 Standard deviation of omega values : 7.149
 
30. Note: chi-1/chi-2 angle correlation Z-score OK Pass

The score expressing how well the chi-1/chi-2 angles of all residues
are corresponding to the populated areas in the database is
within expected ranges for well-refined structures.
 
 chi-1/chi-2 correlation Z-score : -1.151
 
31. Note: Ramachandran plot Pass

In this Ramachandran plot large crosses represent glycines and
small crosses represent the other residues. If too many small crosses
fall outside the boxed areas then the molecule is poorly refined (or
worse).

33. Error: Abnormally short interatomic distances Error

The pairs of atoms listed in the table below have an unusually
short distance.

The contact distances of all atom pairs have been checked. Two
atoms are said to `bump' if they are closer than the sum of their
Van der Waals radii minus 0.40 Angstrom. For hydrogen bonded pairs
a tolerance of 0.55 Angstrom is used.  The first number in the
table tells you how much shorter that specific contact is than the
acceptable limit. The second distance is the distance between the
centers of the two atoms.

The last text-item on each line represents the status of the atom
pair.  The text `INTRA' means that the bump is between atoms that
are explicitly listed in the PDB file. `INTER' means it is an
inter-symmetry bump. If a line contains the text 'HB', the bump
criterium was relaxed because there could be a hydrogen bond. If
the text 'BF' is present, the sum of the B-factors of the atoms is
higher than 80, which makes the appearance of the bump somewhat
less severe because the atoms probably aren't there anyway.

Bumps between atoms for which the sum of their occupancies is lower
than one are not reported. In any case, each bump is listed in only
one direction.

34. Warning: Abnormal packing environment for some residues Warning

The residues listed in the table below have an unusual packing
environment.

The packing environment of the residues is compared with the
average packing environment for all residues of the same type in
good PDB files.  A low packing score can indicate one of several
things: Poor packing, misthreading of the sequence through the
density, crystal contacts, contacts with a co-factor, or the
residue is part of the active site. It is not uncommon to see a few
of these, but in any case this requires further inspection of the
residue.

None of the residues that have a normal backbone environment have
abnormal rotamers.
 
39. Warning: Unusual backbone conformations Warning

For the residues listed in the table below, the backbone formed by
itself and two neighboring residues on either side is in a
conformation that is not seen very often in the database of solved
protein structures.  The number given in the table is the number of
similar backbone conformations in the database with the same amino
acid in the center.

For this check, backbone conformations are compared with database
structures using C-alpha superpositions with some restraints on the
backbone oxygen positions.

A residue mentioned in the table can be part of a strange loop, or
there might be something wrong with it or its directly surrounding
residues. There are a few of these in every protein, but in any
case it is worth looking at!

44. Note: Histidine type assignments Pass

For all complete HIS residues in the structure a tentative
assignment to HIS-D (protonated on ND1), HIS-E (protonated on NE2),
or HIS-H (protonated on both ND1 and NE2, positively charged) is
made based on the hydrogen bond network.  A second assignment is
made based on which of the Engh and Huber [REF] histidine
geometries fits best to the structure.

In the table below all normal histidine residues are listed. The
assignment based on the geometry of the residue is listed first,
together with the RMS Z-score for the fit to the Engh and Huber
parameters.  For all residues where the H-bond assignment is
different, the assignment is listed in the last columns, together
with its RMS Z-score to the Engh and Huber parameters.

As always, the RMS Z-scores should be close to 1.0 if the residues
were restrained to the Engh and Huber parameters during refinement.

Please note that because the differences between the geometries of
the different types are small it is possible that the geometric
assignment given here does not correspond to the type used in
refinement.  This is especially true if the Z-scores are much higher
than 1.0.

If the two assignments differ, or the ``geometry'' Z-score is high,
it is advisable to verify the hydrogen bond assignment, check the
HIS type used during the refinement and possibly adjust it.

The buried hydrogen bond donors listed in the table below have a
hydrogen atom that is not involved in a hydrogen bond in the
optimized hydrogen bond network.

Hydrogen bond donors that are buried inside the protein normally
use all of their hydrogens to form hydrogen bonds within the
protein. If there are any non hydrogen bonded buried hydrogen bond
donors in the structure they will be listed here. In very good
structures the number of listed atoms will tend to zero.
