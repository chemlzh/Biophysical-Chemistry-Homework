Total number of atoms: 299

Extinction coefficients:

As there are no Trp, Tyr or Cys in the region considered, your protein
should not be visible by UV spectrophotometry.


Estimated half-life:

The N-terminal of the sequence considered is G (Gly).

The estimated half-life is: 30 hours (mammalian reticulocytes, in vitro).
                            >20 hours (yeast, in vivo).
                            >10 hours (Escherichia coli, in vivo).


Instability index:

The instability index (II) is computed to be -33.08
This classifies the protein as stable.



Aliphatic index: 146.25

Grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY): -0.575
